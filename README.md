# TicTacToe Refactoring Kata

Found here is a working, one page implementation of TicTacToe using css, html,
javascript, and jquery. The game includes an unbeatable computer algorithm,
though perhaps not the one you would expect.

## Objective

Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to refactor this code. The approaches
are limitless. The goals are to practice creating seams, write tests for legacy
code, and refactor while keeping the tests passing.

## Playing the game

To play the game, one should be able to simply open the file using any modern
browser. To begin simply click a square.

There are three ways to play:
1. One Player, Player Goes First
1. One Player, Computer Goes First
1. Two Players

### Credits

Thank you to _Dave Moore_ the author of the original code, and the refactoring
challenge.
